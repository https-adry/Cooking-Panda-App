# 🐼 Cooking Panda

**Cooking Panda** is an interactive Swift-based app designed to teach cooking in a fun, engaging way — especially aimed at younger audiences who often find traditional cooking tutorials boring or hard to follow.

It was made by:
**Adriana Palmese - Angelica Sannino - Ciro Cafora - Fabio Fontana - Alessandro Maddaloni - Ali Raza**


## 🎮 Learn to Cook Through Play

We believe that learning should be **fun**, and that's why Cooking Panda uses **gamification** at its core. Gamification applies game-design elements — like points, rewards, challenges, and progression — to non-game environments. In our case, it makes learning to cook:
- More interactive  
- Highly rewarding  
- Easier to retain knowledge  
- Motivating for continued practice  

By turning lessons into levels, recipes into quests, and progress into achievements, Cooking Panda keeps users engaged and entertained while they master the kitchen!

## 🍳 Powered by Smart Tools

To create a rich and dynamic learning experience, we used the following tools and services:

### 🥗 [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/)
An open, crowd-sourced database full of recipes from around the world. It allows Cooking Panda to provide a diverse set of dishes for users to try — from easy snacks to full gourmet meals.

### 🗃️ [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)
Airtable is a powerful cloud-based platform that combines the simplicity of spreadsheets with the structure of a database. We used it to organize content, manage recipe data, and handle user progress tracking in a flexible and scalable way.

### 🎨 ibisPaint
For visuals, we turned to ibisPaint — a professional-level illustration app. All of Cooking Panda’s graphics, characters, and game assets were custom-created to ensure a vibrant and unique user experience.
